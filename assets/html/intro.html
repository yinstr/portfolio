        I probably spent a bit too much time on this portfolio.

        <h2 class="max-width-container">About me</h2>
        <p class="max-width-container">
            I’m a product designer who cares deeply about how things feel in motion. For me, good design is not only about layout or visual polish. It is about rhythm, feedback, timing, and the small interactions that make an experience intuitive without calling attention to themselves.
        </p>
        <p class="max-width-container">
            In my day to day work, there is not always room to explore this as much as I would like. That is why I use side projects and proof of concepts to push further. I enjoy taking complex flows, layered states, and branching logic and shaping them into something that feels simple and natural. Exploring how structure and play can exist together is something I keep coming back to.
        </p>
        <p class="max-width-container">
            I think it is important to refine transitions and micro interactions. They help guide attention, clarify what is happening, and make complex systems easier to understand. When those details are considered, the experience feels more coherent and deliberate.
